Recipe and ingredients for 12 pieces of flat bread

**In a small bowl mix:**
20g yeast
20g sugar
330g warm water

**Add to bowl:**
330g warm milk

**Stir to dissolve yeast. Cover for 10 minutes.**

**Sift together:**
1000g flour
10g salt

**Add to yeast mix:**
30g olive oil

Knead the dough by hand for 2 minutes. The dough should be very soft and a little sticky. Cover the dough for 1 hour and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled in size.

Punch down dough and make a big ball, then divide into 12 equal parts. Make balls. Cover the dough so it doesn't dry out while you roll it out.

Roll out the dough into a circle as wide as the distance from the tip of your pinky finger to the tip of your thumb when stretched apart. The thickness of the dough is about 5 millimeters.

Cook on back of overturned wok without oil, on medium heat for about 3 minutes. When bubbles appear, flip the bread.

Cover hot flatbreads immediately with a tea towel to keep them soft.

All actions are very fast, while one bread is fried, we roll the next one. Fry in a pan in the same way until the bread is golden brown on both sides. Finely chop some parsley. Brush each flat bread with olive oil. Sprinkle with parsley. Add red pepper to taste.
