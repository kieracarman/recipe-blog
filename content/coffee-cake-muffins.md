# Coffee Cake Muffins

**Preheat your oven to 400°F and line or grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin.**

## Streusel Topping

**In a small bowl, whisk together using a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs:**
60g flour
50g sugar
5g cinnamon
1g salt
45g butter, cut into small pieces

**Place the bowl in the refrigerator to keep the streusel cold.**

## Muffins

**In a large bowl, thoroughly whisk together:**
230g flour
22g cornstarch
15g nonfat dry milk powder
8g baking powder (double-acting)
3g baking soda
3g salt

**Using an immersion blender, blend for 60-90 seconds until the mixture is homogenous, lighter in color, slightly thickened, and the sugar is fully dissolved:**
150g sugar
100g eggs (approx. 2 eggs), at room temperature
110g grapeseed oil
120g whole milk, at room temperature
20g honey
6g vanilla extract

**Pour the emulsified wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients. Using a flexible spatula, fold just until the flour streaks disappear. Do not overmix.**

**Gently fold in:**
150g cinnamon baking chips

**Divide the batter evenly among the 12 prepared muffin cups. Fill each cup about two-thirds to three-quarters full.**

Generously sprinkle the chilled streusel topping over the batter in each muffin cup.

**Bake for 7 minutes. Without opening the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 375°F. Continue to bake for another 11-15 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of one comes out clean or with only a few moist crumbs attached.**
