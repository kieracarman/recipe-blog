**Preheat your oven to 425°F and line or grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin.**

## Streusel Topping

**In a small bowl, whisk together:**
60g flour
50g sugar
5g cinnamon
1g salt

**Cut in with a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs:**
45g butter, cut into small pieces

**Place the bowl in the refrigerator to keep the streusel cold.**

## Muffins

**In a large bowl, thoroughly whisk together:**
230g flour
22g cornstarch
15g nonfat dry milk powder
8g baking powder (double-acting)
3g baking soda
3g salt

**Using an immersion blender, blend for 60-90 seconds until the mixture is homogenous, lighter in color, slightly thickened, and the sugar is fully dissolved:**
150g sugar
100g eggs (approx. 2 eggs), at room temperature

**Drizzle in slowly while blending to emulsify:**
110g grapeseed oil

**Slowly add and blend until homogenous:**
120g whole milk, at room temperature
20g honey
6g vanilla extract

**Fold wet into dry just until the flour streaks disappear, do not overmix. Cover and let batter rest for 20 minutes.**

**Gently fold in:**
150g cinnamon baking chips

**Divide the batter evenly among the 12 prepared muffin cups. Fill each cup about two-thirds to three-quarters full.**

**Generously sprinkle the chilled streusel topping over the batter in each muffin cup.**

**Bake for 7 minutes at 425°F. Without opening the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 375°F. Continue to bake for another 11-15 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of one comes out clean or with only a few moist crumbs attached.**
